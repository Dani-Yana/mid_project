My project: Exploration of the latest available data on crime involving bicycles (theft and traffic accidents) in Berlin

Motivation: Cycling has been growing steadily in popularity in Berlin and cyclists face different risks by choosing this mobility option. As a passionate bicycle rider in my home city I want to find out more
about those risks, and analyze if the risks are higher during night time.
